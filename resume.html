            <div class="intro">
                <p>I have graduated from the University of Texas at San Antonio with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree in May of 2022. I am striving to learn more and develop my skills as a front-end web developer, honing my individual skills in UI/UX but I am also interested in learning about other concentrations outside my field such as IT, Cyber Security or Game Development.</p>
                <p>Outside of my coursework, I have worked on my resume website where I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a website that displays what my resume has on it. I have also collaborated in different projects such as my Smash Bros Ultimate Wiki and my attendance at Rowdy Hack where I created a server to hold songs and those songs would be then downloaded from the server onto an app that my team and I created. I have also mostly self-taught myself Unity, creating the UI/UX in the zombie survival game as well as creating an 2D endless runner.</p>
                <p>Outside of my coding work my volunteer work consists of helping out at my local Buddhist temple where I helped with setting up the festivities, some translation work, manual labor and babysitting small children. I also have 100+ hrs at my community library where I helped children to the elderly find what they need, checking out books, checking in books and making sure said books go back on the appropriate shelf.</p>
